In computer science, **MinHash** (or the min-wise independent permutations locality sensitive hashing scheme) is a technique for **quickly estimating how similar two sets are**. The scheme was invented by Andrei Broder (1997), and initially used in the AltaVista search engine to detect duplicate web pages and eliminate them from search results. It has also been applied in large-scale clustering problems, such as clustering documents by the similarity of their sets of words.
